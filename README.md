# Installing

As of now you can only install on Chromium-based browsers, using the "Load unpacked" function on the extensions page. If you don't know how to do it, i'll leave a [tutorial](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/).

# Usage

After the extension is installed, all you need to do is right-click the HTML input and choose the pattern you want to apply in the context menu.
